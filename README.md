# SoccerScope: Football Player Statistics Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to analyze and visualize football player statistics from the top 5 leagues. The main objectives are:

1. Create a general visualization of the data, showing the number of players by position and nationality.
2. Develop a dashboard to analyze individual player statistics based on their position, experience level (MP), and number of goals scored (Gls).
3. Compare player performances across different leagues based on goals scored, assists made, and minutes played.
